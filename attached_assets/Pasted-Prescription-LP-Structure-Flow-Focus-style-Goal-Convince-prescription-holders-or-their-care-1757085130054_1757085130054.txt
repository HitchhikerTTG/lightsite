Prescription LP — Structure & Flow (Focus-style)

Goal: Convince prescription holders (or their caregivers) that sending the prescription to iD = the easiest, safest way to secure their supplies.
Tone: Practical, relieving, authoritative but warm.
Form strategy: Same as other pages → short Step-1 forms repeated, with Fast-Track after first submit.
