General principles
Single-column, centered layout for readability (max 820px content width).
Generous spacing: each section is a block with 50–70px padding top & bottom, so the reader can breathe.
Neutral background rhythm: alternate between white and soft grey/soft teal blocks to create visual pauses.
CTAs = forms (not just buttons), placed every ~3 sections, with visual variation.
Imagery: lifestyle photos (everyday moments, smiling discreetly, calm, not “clinical”) + product packshots (pads, pants, underpads).

2. Empathy Section (soft grey background)

Copy mirrors user’s experience: leaks at work, exercise, night → the mental weight.

✨ Visual Rhythm
White / Soft grey / Soft teal / White / Grey … → alternating blocks give structure and relief.
Forms in cards with shadows → stand out without being aggressive.
Lifestyle + product images interleaved → balance between emotional reassurance and tangible proof.
Typography: calm, friendly sans-serif (e.g. Inter, as we used).
